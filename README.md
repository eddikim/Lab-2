Geo-Tagged Tweet Narrative

<p>For my topic, I selected the search terms "StopAsianHate" given the recent news of the mass shooting in 
Monterey Park today on Lunar New Year. Some of the other parameters I used were looking at tweets
dating from 1/17/23 and I wanted to look at geo-tagged tweets coming directly from Monterey Park,
San Francisco with it being a neighboring city, and Manhattan to gather some tweets from the east
coast. Being an Asian-American myself and resonating with the Stop Asian Hate movement, I wanted to 
analyze how people on twitter were reacting to the news and compare this between these locations as 
I felt they each have a strong presence of asian communities. I wanted to include Seattle too, 
however there were only three usable tweets based on my parameters. There are strong similarities 
between all of the word clouds I created, for example words attached to strong emotions such as 
"heartbroken", "angry", and "scared" were present on all three of the word clouds. Some other words 
that all of them shared were "community" and "family". In terms of differences, both of the 
California location word clouds spoke more heavily about Monterey Park as it takes up more space 
on the first (Monterey Park) and the third (San Francisco) word clouds. However, there are certainly
more similarities than differences in the word choices surrounding tweets about Stop Asian Hate. 
I would say the reason for patterns of similarity that I observed comes from the fact that people
speaking against Asian Hate would likely feel very emotional in their writing and it is not particularly 
a controversial view in wanting to protect members of our asian communities while speaking in condemnation
against the violence. As for the differences, the larger mentions of Monterey Park in the first and third
word clouds compared to the second are likely due to location since the shooting took place in the 
state of California. Some ways my research could be improved in the future would be choosing a topic
that has a greater diversity of opinions and either focusing on various cities within a single state 
or expanding my search to cities all around the country. In terms of ways to improve my research 
specifically on the chosen topic of Asian hate crimes, I would actually try to search through locations
that have a very small Asian population to see if there are more unique perspectives on the movement. 
Much of what I found from the data was what I expected before the exercise. I knew a lot of the words 
would be emotion heavy given how tragic of an event this was and I felt that they would create 
compelling visualizations to stand in solidarity against Asian hate crimes. Something that really stood
out to me were the sheer number of tweets that came out just from today since most of the tweets are 
dated 1/22/23 in the datasets, so many of the words people used to react to the shooting felt that 
much more powerful to me.</p>
