# Geo-Tagged Tweet Narrative

<p>For my topic, I selected the search terms "StopAsianHate" given the recent news of the mass shooting in Monterey Park on Lunar New Year. Some of the other parameters I used were looking at tweets dating from 1/17/23, and I wanted to look at geo-tagged tweets coming directly from Monterey Park where the shooting occurred, San Francisco with it being a neighboring city, and Manhattan to gather some tweets from the East Coast and to satisfy my own curiosity. Being an Asian-American myself and resonating with the Stop Asian Hate movement, I wanted to analyze how people on Twitter were reacting to the news and compare this between these locations as I felt they each have a strong presence of Asian communities. Although I wanted to include Seattle as one of my locations, unfortunately there were only three usable tweets based on my set parameters. To specify my locational parameters, Monterey Park's coordinates were set to 34.05525802411425° N, -118.16959975827815° W with a radius of 3.48 mi, Manhattan was set to 40.79050715121029° N, -73.96573504228395° W with a radius of 13.10 mi, and San Francisco was set to 37.75957929020267° N, -122.44824525449988° W with a radius of 9.04 mi. There are strong similarities between all the word clouds I created, for example words attached to strong emotions such as "heartbroken", "angry", and "horrific" were present on all three of my word clouds. Some other words that all of them shared were "community", "family", and "love" which goes to show the dichotomy of the matter. On one hand, members of the Asian community alongside our allies are frustrated with the perpetrators of violence, but they are also sending their love and prayers to the victims and their family members. In terms of differences, both of the California location word clouds spoke more heavily about Monterey Park as words like "shooting" and "killed" occupy a significant amount of space on the first (Monterey Park) and the third (San Francisco) word clouds. However, there are certainly more similarities than differences in the word choices surrounding tweets about Stop Asian Hate. I would say the reason for patterns of similarity that I observed comes from the fact that people speaking publicly against Asian Hate would likely feel very emotional in their writing, and it is not particularly a controversial view in wanting to protect members of our Asian communities while speaking in condemnation against the violence. As for the differences, the larger mentions of the Monterey Park shooting in the first and third word clouds compared to the second word cloud are likely due to location since the shooting took place in the state of California. Some ways my research could be improved in the future would be choosing a search term relating to Asian hate crimes that have a greater diversity of opinions and either focusing on various cities within a single state or expanding my search to cities all around a single state. Some other ways to improve my research specifically on the chosen topic of Asian hate crimes would be to search through locations that have a very small Asian population to see if there are more unique perspectives on the movement. Much of what I found from the data was what I expected before the exercise, in that many people would be posting tweets fresh off of the mass shooting to both voice their concerns and raise awareness. I knew a lot of the words would be emotion heavy given how tragic of an event this was, and I felt that they would create compelling visualizations to stand in solidarity against Asian hate crimes. Something that really stood out to me were the sheer number of tweets that came out just from the same day of the shooting as most of the tweets are dated 1/22/23 in the datasets, so many of the words people used to react to the shooting felt that much more powerful to me.</p>
